        <h1>About Me
        </h1>
        <h2>The improvement of the foundations of our communities helped me choose business as my field of study. 
            I set high standards for myself in school, evidenced by my six placements on the University of Iowa President’s List, and I work tirelessly to reach my goals. 
            Outside of the classroom, through joining different campus organizations I have met individuals that share a mutual passion for networking and exceeding expectations. 
            Last summer, I served as an Assurance Intern at EY where I was able to prove my skills in professional skepticism and attention to detail when dealing with complex accounting issues.
